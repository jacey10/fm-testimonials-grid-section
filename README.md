## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- It's my first time of placing items using 'grid-area'. I found it very easy to learn and it was fun.

- For the mobile layout, I applied a width of 100% to allow the card to stretch. For the bigger screen sizes, I used height of 100% to let the cards stretch also.


### Continued development
- I would continue to explore how to create layouts that are responsive across many screens and devices.

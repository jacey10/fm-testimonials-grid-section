## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- I had a better understanding of how to use flexbox to create responsive layouts and where to use it.
- I haven't really worked with lists and tables in a long time. Neither did I have fully understand how to style them. While doing so, I stumbled on some problems like choosing the right border-bottom for the table and styling markers for list. This challenge gave me the opportunity to learn a lot more about how to do all these.
- I had a better understanding of "width:100%" and how elements with this property expands to fill the width of their containers.
- I implemented the mobile first design, before writing media queries for larger screens (i.e. tablets and desktops).
- With the aid of ChatGPT, I learned how to use customers markers instead of default list markers to avoid layout issues.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

### Continued development
- I would continue to explore how to create layouts that are responsive across many screens and devices.
- I would learn more about styling lists and tables.
- I would also learn more about using Absolute positioning.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
